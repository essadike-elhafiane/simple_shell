.SH DESCRIPTION
Shell is a UNIX term for the interactive user interface with an operating system. The shell is the layer of programming that understands
and executes the commands a user enters. In some systems, the shell is called a command interpreter. A shell usually implies an interface
with a command syntax 

.B Overview

The simple shell is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes other commands. It is the program that is started when a user logs into the system. It incorporates many features to aid interactive use and has the advantage that the interpretative language is common to both interactive and non-interactive use (shell scripts). That is, commands can be typed directly to the running simple shell or can be put into a file, which can be executed directly by the simple shell.
